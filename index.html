                <p>Our users tend to get tired of constantly digging to find 
                    music that fits their needs and are in search of quality 
                    music that accurately reflects how they feel. Our solution 
                    is to get away from the mainstream music applications such 
                    as YouTube, Spotify and Apple Music, and provide a way for 
                    users to effortlessly sift through the musical underground.
